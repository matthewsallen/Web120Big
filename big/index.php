 <h2 class="pageID">Matt's Web 120 BIG Site</h2>
 <p>The BIG assignment was a very complex and time-consuming assignment. I learned modify elements to make them responsive, and then ensure the HTML and CSS are valid. Many of the codes I attained from Google and Youtube made my HTML "invalid," so I had to troubleshoot. It was interesting to learn how CSS interacts with HTML, and which tool is required for each action. </p><br>
